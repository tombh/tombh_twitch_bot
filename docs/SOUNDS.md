# Channel Sounds

Current available sounds:

## `!arrived`
* Your own personal arrival sound that can be played once per stream.
* Please submit your sound proposal to: https://app.element.io/#/room/#twitch-sound-requests:matrix.org or https://github.com/tombh/tombh_twitch_bot/issues
* Try to limit this sound to 10 seconds or less.
* Don't use DMCA'able clips. Also try not to choose operating system sounds or sounds from games as those might confuse people playing games or using an operating system.
* Sounds should not be NSFW.

## `!chirp`
* Plays a random bird song from a pool of bird songs. Please offer new bird songs that you know and like from this online database: https://xeno-canto.org/
* Spammable, anybody can call this command as much as they want.
* There is a small chance of triggering a RUBBER CHICKEN SCREAM. And what's more, if you get the RUBBER CHICKEN SCREAM üêî you get put in the pool to _repeat_ the RUBBER CHICKEN SCREAM ü§™ So there is a non-zero possibility that the RUBBER CHICKEN SCREAM will play on repeat until the heat death of the universe or the end of the stream (whichever comes first).
